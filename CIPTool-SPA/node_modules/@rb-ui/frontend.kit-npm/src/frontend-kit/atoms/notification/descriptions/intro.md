For the notification text variant, go to Form field and look at the API example.

The notification banner and default variants are showcased here. Banner notifications do have a JS API which is described at the bottom of this page.

The neutral level does have an optional Icon, the other three levels uses the outlined icons from the icon-font as showcased here.

Additionally, there is a small size for the default variation of notification bar. The other two variations should not be changed in size.

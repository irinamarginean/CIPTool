A banner notification will be shown on the bottom of the viewport, so the content is always visible to the user. See the API documentation as well as the JS demo code at the end of this page for details.

<div class="frontend-kit__notification a-notification -warning"><i class="a-ui-icon a-ui-icon--ui-ic-warning"></i><div class="a-notification__content">
    On page load, banner notification components will move to the end of the DOM automatically. This is needed to ensure the bottom-of-viewport display.
</div></div>

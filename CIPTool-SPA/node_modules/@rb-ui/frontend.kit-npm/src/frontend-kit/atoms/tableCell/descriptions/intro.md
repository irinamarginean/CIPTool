The table cell is the smallest element of the table. For the `<td>` or `<td>` elements are two style modificators available.

By adding the `-bold` class, the containing text will be rendered in bold. By adding `-highlighted` the cell will be rendered with a gray background to bring attention to the user and an example use case would be a header. Both modificators can be mixed.

The progress indicator comes in two variants and can be used to show a length of a process or express an unknown wait time, e.g. fetching a resource.

The first one is the `determinate` variant, which is a completable progress bar for which you can set the value via the style. The second variant is the `indeterminate` which is just a loading indicator for an unspecified wait time and therefore showing an animation only.

Page indicator can be used to indicate to users the current page. It comes with two types: Dot-typed indicators (`default`) and numbered indicators (`-numbered`).

For numbered indicators, a maximum of 7 items are shown. If there are more pages, it is shown with three dots. See examples below.

Component events:
- prevClicked - triggered when prev arrow was clicked
- nextClicked - triggered when next arrow was clicked
- clicked - triggered when other page was selected
- indexChanged - triggered when an index of the selected page was changed

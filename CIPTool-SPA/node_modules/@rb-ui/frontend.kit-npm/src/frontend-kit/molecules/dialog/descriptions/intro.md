A dialog can be used to present the user with an immediately needed choice. It comes in three variants:

* The default dialog does have a text and two choices. A close icon is optional.
* The small dialog only has one option, and an optional close icon.
* The alert dialog has a headline, and one of four levels: info, success, warning and error. Alert dialogs do not have a close icon.

Any of these can be used as a modal dialog. See the example below, the API documentation as well as JS example code at the end of this page.

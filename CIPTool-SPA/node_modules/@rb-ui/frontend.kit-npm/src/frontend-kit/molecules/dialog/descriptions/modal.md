A modal dialog will cover the whole screen and dim the background, so the content is the only thing remaining in the user's focus. Find the code for this example below.

<div class="frontend-kit__notification a-notification -warning"><i class="a-ui-icon a-ui-icon--ui-ic-warning"></i><div class="a-notification__content">
    On page load, modal dialog components will move to the end of the DOM automatically. This is needed to ensure the fullscreen display.
</div></div>

A popover is a larger variant of the tooltip. It can optionally have a button, a close button, or a headline, and one of 12 arrow positions.

The popover component has a JS API to attach the popover to any element. The arrow position determines the popover position, so be careful to not place it off-screen. See the gallery example and the API description below for details.

An attached popover will be positioned absolutely to point to a given DOM element.

<div class="frontend-kit__notification a-notification -warning"><i class="a-ui-icon a-ui-icon--ui-ic-warning"></i><div class="a-notification__content">
    On page load, attached popover components will move to the end of the DOM automatically. This is needed to ensure the correct positioning.
</div></div>
